# Mt-Kilimanjaro
Together with my friend, we created a poster about changes of snow cover on Mt. Kilimanjaro between years 1987-2022.
The code for donwloading, clustering and exporting TIFFs was created in Google Earth Engine. The images were used from Landsat 4, 7 and 8.
The rest of the analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Pro.
